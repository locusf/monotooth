To compile monotooth, you will have to have MonoDevelop. This is by far the easiest way to compile the entire project, demos and tests. To compile the native sources, I use waf (http://www.freehackers.org/~tnagy/waf.html, latest SVN), since it has a very intuitive build system. 

PREREQUISITES:
* Bluez libraries (for example in Ubuntu, libbluetooth2)
* Some kind of bluetooth device attached and installed on the system
* A linux-based operating system

So the steps are:
1. Compile the entire solution with monodevelop (open monotooth.mds from the root directory)
2. cd to src/native/linux
3. run waf configure
4. run waf, the binaries are put to $MONOTOOTHDIR/bin/Debug
5. Try out the demos, make sure you have a bluetooth dongle ( and 2 computers :) ).
6. (optional) To run the tests, make sure you have correct reference set to "tests->References", you usually need to change this. Just remove the current "monotooth" reference and then re-add it by searching the monotooth.dll from the bin/Debug folder.
